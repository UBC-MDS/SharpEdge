# Contributing

SharpEdge is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug reports,
and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

### Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under 
[our license](./LICENSE). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can.
Please note that by contributing to this project,
you agree to abide by our [code of conduct](./CONDUCT.md).

### How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by
   email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use
   one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems
   or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][new-issues]. This allows us to
   assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
   [included below](#using-github).

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a [pull request][pull-request] from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
Please tag an administrator as a reviewer to ensure your PR is reviewed promptly.
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

### What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from implementing new features and improving
existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting bug
reports or fixing bugs about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.

### Contribution Guidelines

#### Implement Feature

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

#### Report Bugs

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

#### Write Documentation

You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute to any
part of the documentation, such as the official docs, docstrings, or even
on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### What *Not* to Contribute

We are not looking for exercises or materials that only run on one
platform. Our package typically contains a mixture of Windows, macOS, and
Linux users; in order to be usable, our package must run equally well on all
three.
